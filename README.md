Embedded / Firmware Engineer focused on C/C++ drivers, hardware abstraction layers,
and real-device validation. I work primarily with ESP32 and BlueNRG systems and
explore ML systems (Tiny LLMs, optimization) as side projects.

## Featured Projects

🔹 **ESP32 Fall Detection**  
ESP32 + IMU fall detection firmware with Wi-Fi provisioning, EEPROM storage, and
webhook alerts.  
👉 https://github.com/Jay2cop/ESP32_Fall_Detection

🔹 **BlueNRG NAND Flash Driver (C++)**  
C → C++ refactor of a Winbond W25N01GW NAND flash driver using SPI + DMA HAL.
Validated on real hardware (.bn flashed).

🔹 **Tiny LLM**  
Mini transformer trained from scratch with CLPSO-based head fine-tuning experiments.

## Technical Focus
- Embedded & Firmware: C, C++, ESP32, BlueNRG, SPI, I2C, DMA
- Systems: HAL design, driver refactoring, UART debugging
- ML: PyTorch, Tiny LLMs, optimization (CLPSO)

## Other Projects
I also maintain small web applications (weather, translation) built mainly to explore
API integration, UI flows, and tooling.
